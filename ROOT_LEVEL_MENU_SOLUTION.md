# 🚀 VAT Reports Menu - Root Level Solution

## ✅ **Solution Applied**: Root Level Menu

Since the parent menu references weren't working, I've created the VAT Reports menu at the **root level** of Odoo, which is the most compatible approach.

## 📋 **What You Should See Now**:

After upgrading the module, you should see these menus in the **main Odoo menu bar**:

```
🏠 Home | 💬 Discuss | 📅 Calendar | 📊 CRM | 💼 Accounting | ⚙️ Settings
                                                    ↑
                                            Click here first
```

Then in the main menu (app drawer):
```
📊 Ecuador VAT Reports     ← NEW! Click this
📋 Ecuador Reports         ← For other modules (ATS, 103)
💼 Accounting             ← Standard Odoo
⚙️ Settings               ← Standard Odoo
...
```

## 🎯 **How to Access**:

### Method 1: Direct Access
1. Click the **9-dots menu** (app drawer) at top-left
2. Look for **"Ecuador VAT Reports"** 
3. Click it → Opens VAT wizard directly

### Method 2: Through Accounting (if parent menus work)
1. Go to **Accounting** app
2. Look for **Ecuador Reports** or **VAT Reports** in the menu

## 🔧 **Next Steps**:

1. **Upgrade the module**:
   - Apps → Search "Ecuador VAT" → Click "Upgrade"

2. **Clear cache**:
   - Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R

3. **Check main menu**:
   - Look for "Ecuador VAT Reports" in the app drawer

## ✅ **Expected Behavior**:
- Click "Ecuador VAT Reports" 
- Opens VAT Report Wizard
- Select Company, Month, Year
- Generate reports and export CSV/PDF

## 🚨 **If Still Not Visible**:
The menu should definitely appear at root level. If not:

1. **Check module installation**:
   ```
   Apps → Installed → Search "Ecuador" 
   Should show: "Ecuador VAT Reports (Form 103/104)"
   ```

2. **Check user permissions**:
   - User needs "Accounting: User" or "Accounting: Manager" rights
   - Settings → Users & Companies → Users → [Your User] → Access Rights

3. **Module might not be fully installed**:
   - Try uninstalling and reinstalling the module
