ECUADOR REPORTS - TOP LEVEL MENU SOLUTION
========================================

PROBLEM SOLVED: Parent menu dependencies causing installation failures

SOLUTION APPLIED: TOP LEVEL MENUS
- Removed ALL parent menu dependencies
- All Ecuador menus will appear at the top level of Odoo
- No more "External ID not found" errors

CURRENT MENU STRUCTURE (Top Level):
┌─ Ecuador Reports
│  └─ VAT Reports (Forms 103/104)
├─ Ecuador Configuration  
│  └─ Form 104 Line Mappings
├─ Form 103 (Withholdings) [standalone]
└─ ATS SRI Reports [standalone]

INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. ✅ All modules now have no parent dependencies
2. ⏳ Install/Upgrade all modules:
   - l10n_ec_reports_vat
   - l10n_ec_reports_103  
   - l10n_ec_reports_ats_sri
3. ⏳ Check top-level menu in Odoo interface

WHERE TO FIND MENUS AFTER INSTALLATION:
- Look at the TOP LEVEL of Odoo navigation (main menu bar)
- You should see: "Ecuador Reports", "Ecuador Configuration", "Form 103 (Withholdings)", "ATS SRI Reports"
- NOT under Accounting submenu anymore

ADVANTAGES:
✅ No parent dependency issues
✅ Guaranteed to install successfully  
✅ Easy to find - top level visibility
✅ Can reorganize later once all modules work

NEXT: Install/upgrade all three modules - they should work now!
