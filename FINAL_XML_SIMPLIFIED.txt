FINAL XML STRUCTURE FIX - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH
============================================

❌ PREVIOUS PROBLEM: "Element odoo has extra content: data, line 3"
The <data> wrapper was causing validation issues in this Odoo installation.

✅ SOLUTION: SIMPLIFIED XML STRUCTURE
Removed all <data> wrappers and action references that might be missing.

FINAL CLEAN STRUCTURE:
- No <data> wrapper (direct menuitem under <odoo>)
- No web_icon (might not exist)
- No action references (avoiding "External ID not found" errors)
- Simple parent hierarchy

CURRENT MENU STRUCTURE:
┌─ Ecuador Reports (TOP LEVEL - Main Navigation)
│  ├─ VAT Reports (Forms 103/104)
│  ├─ ATS SRI Reports
│  ├─ Form 103 (Withholdings)
│  └─ Ecuador Configuration
│     ├─ Form 104 Line Mappings
│     └─ ATS Catalogs
│        ├─ ID Types
│        ├─ Document Types
│        ├─ Payment Methods
│        └─ Sustain Codes

KEY CHANGES:
✅ Removed <data> wrapper from all modules
✅ Removed web_icon attribute (might not exist)
✅ Removed action references temporarily (avoiding dependency issues)
✅ Simplified parent structure
✅ Clean XML structure for Odoo 17

INSTALLATION ORDER (should work now):
1. ✅ Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_vat (creates Ecuador Reports at top level)
2. ✅ Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_ats_sri (adds ATS under Ecuador Reports)
3. ✅ Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_103 (adds Form 103 under Ecuador Reports)

RESULT EXPECTED:
- "Ecuador Reports" should appear in main navigation bar
- All Ecuador reporting modules grouped together
- No XML validation errors

This is the most minimal, compatible XML structure possible!
