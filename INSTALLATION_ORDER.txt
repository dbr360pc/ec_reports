ECUADOR REPORTS INSTALLATION ORDER
=================================

PROBLEM: 
The l10n_ec_reports_103 module is trying to reference "l10n_ec_reports_vat.menu_ec_reports_root"
but this menu doesn't exist yet because the VAT module hasn't been properly updated.

SOLUTION - INSTALL IN THIS EXACT ORDER:

STEP 1: INSTALL/UPGRADE VAT MODULE FIRST
========================================
1. Go to Apps → Update Apps List (if needed)
2. Search for "l10n_ec_reports_vat" 
3. Install or Upgrade this module FIRST
4. Wait for it to complete successfully
5. Verify no errors occurred

STEP 2: VERIFY VAT MODULE MENU EXISTS
====================================
After VAT module installs successfully:
1. Go to Accounting → Reports
2. You should see "Ecuador Reports" menu
3. Under it should be "VAT Reports (Forms 103/104)"

STEP 3: INSTALL OTHER MODULES
============================
Only AFTER the VAT module is successfully installed:
1. Install "l10n_ec_reports_ats_sri"
2. Install "l10n_ec_reports_103"

CURRENT STATUS:
✓ VAT module menu structure is fixed (menu_ec_reports_root created)
✓ Manifest updated to use correct menu file
⚠ Need to upgrade VAT module first before others can reference its menus

The External ID "l10n_ec_reports_vat.menu_ec_reports_root" will only exist 
AFTER the VAT module is successfully installed/upgraded!
