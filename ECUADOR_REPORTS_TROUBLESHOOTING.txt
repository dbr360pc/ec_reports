ECUADOR REPORTS NOT SHOWING - TROUBLESHOOTING
============================================

PROBLEM: Ecuador Reports menu is not visible

SOLUTION APPLIED: Moved Ecuador Reports to TOP LEVEL
- Removed parent dependency that might not exist
- Ecuador Reports will now appear in the main menu bar

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. UPGRADE VAT MODULE FIRST:
   - Go to Apps → Search "l10n_ec_reports_vat"
   - Click "Upgrade" button
   - Wait for completion

2. CHECK TOP-LEVEL MENU:
   After upgrading VAT module, look for "Ecuador Reports" in:
   - Main navigation bar (top level)
   - NOT under Accounting anymore

3. IF STILL NOT VISIBLE:
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
   - Log out and log back in
   - Check Apps → Search "Ecuador" to verify modules are installed

4. VERIFY MODULE STATUS:
   In Apps, check that all modules show "Installed":
   ✓ Ecuador VAT Reports (Form 103/104)
   ✓ Ecuador ATS SRI Reports  
   ✓ Ecuador Form 103 Reports

CURRENT STRUCTURE (After VAT upgrade):
┌─ Ecuador Reports (TOP LEVEL)
│  ├─ VAT Reports (Forms 103/104)
│  ├─ ATS SRI Reports (after ATS module upgrade)
│  └─ Form 103 (Withholdings) (after Form 103 module upgrade)

NEXT STEP: 
Upgrade the VAT module first - this will create the Ecuador Reports menu that should be visible at the top level!
