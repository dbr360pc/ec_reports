======================================

ISSUE: VAT REPORTS WIZARD and ATS SRI REPORTS WIZARD are not appearing

DIAGNOSIS CHECKLIST:

1. ✓ ACTIONS ARE DEFINED:
   - action_vat_report_wizard exists in l10n_ec_reports_vat/views/vat_report_wizard_views.xml
   - action_ats_report_wizard exists in l10n_ec_reports_ats_sri/views/ats_report_wizard_views.xml

2. ✓ MENUS REFERENCE ACTIONS:
   - VAT menu references action="action_vat_report_wizard" 
   - ATS menu references action="action_ats_report_wizard"

3. ✓ MANIFESTS INCLUDE WIZARD FILES:
   - VAT: includes 'views/vat_report_wizard_views.xml'
   - ATS: includes 'views/ats_report_wizard_views.xml'

ROOT CAUSE POSSIBILITIES:

A) MODULES NOT UPGRADED:
   The most likely cause is that modules haven't been upgraded with recent changes.

B) LOADING ORDER ISSUE:
   Wizard views might be loading before menu views.

C) SECURITY PERMISSIONS:
   User might not have account.group_account_user or account.group_account_manager groups.

SOLUTIONS TO TRY:

STEP 1: FORCE MODULE UPGRADE
1. Go to Apps → Remove "Apps" filter
2. Search "Ecuador" 
3. Upgrade ALL THREE modules:
   - l10n_ec_reports_vat (FIRST)
   - l10n_ec_reports_ats_sri  
   - l10n_ec_reports_103
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
5. Log out and log back in

STEP 2: CHECK SECURITY GROUPS
1. Go to Settings → Users & Companies → Users
2. Edit your user
3. Under "Access Rights" tab verify you have:
   - Accounting: Administrator or Show Accounting Features

STEP 3: CHECK MENU LOCATION
Navigate to: Accounting → Reports → Ecuador Reports
(NOT Accounting → Ecuador Reports)

STEP 4: VERIFY INSTALLATION
1. Go to Apps
2. Search "Ecuador VAT Reports"
3. Should show "Installed" status
4. If not, install it first

If wizards still don't appear, the issue is likely that the parent menu "account.menu_finance" doesn't exist in your Odoo installation.
