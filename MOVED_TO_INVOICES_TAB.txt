CHANGE MADE:
- Added parent="account.menu_finance" to Ecuador Reports root menu
- This places it under the main Accounting/Invoicing menu

NEXT STEP:
1. Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_vat module

3. All existing submenus will automatically follow

The parent menu "account.menu_finance" is the main Invoicing/Billing menu that we know works in your system.
