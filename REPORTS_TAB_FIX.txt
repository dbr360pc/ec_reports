REPORTS TAB NOT SHOWING - DIAGNOSIS & FIX
========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Used wrong parent menu: account.menu_finance_reports
- Correct parent should be: account.menu_finance_reporting

CHANGES MADE:
✅ Fixed VAT module parent: account.menu_finance_reports → account.menu_finance_reporting  
✅ Fixed Form 103 module parent: account.menu_finance_reports → account.menu_finance_reporting
✅ Fixed ATS module parent: account.menu_finance_reports → account.menu_finance_reporting

NEXT STEPS:

1. UPGRADE ALL MODULES:
   Since we changed the parent menus, you need to upgrade all modules:
   - Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_vat
   - Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_103  
   - Upgrade l10n_ec_reports_ats_sri

2. CHECK MENU LOCATION:
   After upgrading, look for Ecuador Reports under:
   - Accounting → Reporting (not Reports)
   - OR Invoicing → Reporting

3. ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS TO CHECK:
   If still not visible, check these menu paths:
   - Accounting → Reporting → Ecuador Reports
   - Invoicing → Reporting → Ecuador Reports  
   - Apps → Search "Ecuador" to verify modules are installed

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Clear browser cache after upgrade
- Refresh the page (F5)
- Log out and log back in to refresh menu cache

The parent "account.menu_finance_reporting" is the correct location for accounting reports in Odoo 17.
