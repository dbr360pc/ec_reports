VAT MODULE INSTALLATION FIX
===========================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Menu trying to reference actions before they're loaded
- action_vat_report_wizard doesn't exist when menu_views.xml is processed
- action_ec_104_line doesn't exist when menu_views.xml is processed

SOLUTION APPLIED:
âœ… Removed action references temporarily from menu items:
   - menu_ec_vat_reports (removed action="action_vat_report_wizard")  
   - menu_ec_104_line_mappings (removed action="action_ec_104_line")

CURRENT STATUS:
- Menus will be created as containers without actions
- Actions will be created by wizard/view files later in the process
- After installation, we can reconnect the actions to menus

INSTALLATION RESULT EXPECTED:
- VAT module should install successfully now
- Menu structure will be created
- Individual action connections can be fixed post-installation

NEXT STEPS:
1. Try installing l10n_ec_reports_vat again
2. Should work without RPC errors now
3. After installation, we can update menus to include actions

The module will install with menu structure intact, just without the action connections initially.
