PARENT MENU ISSUE RESOLUTION
============================

PROBLEM: Trying different parent menus but they don't exist in this Odoo installation
- account.menu_finance_reports ❌ (doesn't exist)
- account.menu_finance_reporting ❌ (doesn't exist)

CURRENT TRY: account.menu_finance
- This is the root Accounting menu which should always exist

ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES IF THIS FAILS:

1. USE NO PARENT (ROOT LEVEL):
   Remove parent attribute completely - menu will appear at top level

2. COMMON ODOO 17 PARENT MENUS TO TRY:
   - account.menu_finance (Accounting root)
   - base.menu_reporting (Reporting root) 
   - account.menu_account_reports
   - account.account_reports_menu

3. FIND EXISTING MENUS:
   If current attempt fails, we need to:
   - Check what accounting menus actually exist in your system
   - Look at standard Odoo accounting module menus
   - Use developer mode to inspect menu structure

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Updated VAT module: parent="account.menu_finance"
✅ Updated Form 103 module: parent="account.menu_finance" 
✅ Updated ATS module: parent="account.menu_finance"

NEXT STEP: Try upgrading l10n_ec_reports_vat again
- If it works: Ecuador Reports will appear under main Accounting menu
- If it fails: We'll use no parent (root level) as fallback

The menu will appear under Accounting section if account.menu_finance exists.
